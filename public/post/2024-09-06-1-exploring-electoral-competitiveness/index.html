<p><em>How competitive are presidential elections in the United States?</em></p>
<p>In order to predict the outcome of the 2024 presidential election, it is important to base the prediction model on an understanding of past elections at the national level.</p>
<p><strong>Generally speaking, national elections have been competitive between the two major parties since the election of President Franklin Roosevelt in 1948.</strong> In the succeeding 75+ years, neither party has been able to maintain a significant monopoly over the Presidency.</p>

Within this time frame, the margin of victory has lessened significantly over the past 40 years. From the 1956 re-election of President Eisenhower to the 1984 re-election of President Reagan, the winning candidate received an average of 55.85% of the two-party popular voteshare. Indeed, 1964 and 1972 the winning candidate won with a margin of 22.69% and 23.58% respectively. Since 1988, however, the winning candidate has only recieved on average 52.23% of the two-party popular voteshare. This includes the 2000 election of Bush v. Gore wherin Bush not only won with a negative margin, but an incredibly narrow 0.52%.
<p>To better understand the factors which contribute to the competitiveness of a presidential election, it is important to understand the narratives of both the landslide victories and narrow margins of the past 75+ years.</p>
