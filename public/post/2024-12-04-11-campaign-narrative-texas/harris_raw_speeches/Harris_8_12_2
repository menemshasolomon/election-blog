Speaker 1 (00:00):

… [inaudible 00:00:00] who are going to fight for everyday working-class people like myself. I know my union is going to fight to elect Kamala Harris as president and Tim Walz as vice president, and I know that we’re going to win this election. We vote. We win. We vote. We win. We vote. We win. Bye.

Speaker 2 (00:46):

Please welcome United States Representative Susie Lee.

MUSIC (00:49):

[foreign language 00:00:49].

Susie Lee (00:49):

All right. Oh, look. Oh, I love the look of this. Hello, Las Vegas. Are we ready to win?

Audience (01:17):

Yeah.

Susie Lee (01:20):

Are we ready to send Kamala Harris and Tim Walz to the White House?

Audience (01:26):

Yeah.

Susie Lee (01:30):

Now, listen, aren’t they a breath of fresh air? It’s real easy to see Vice President Harris is a clear contrast to a babbling, lying, convicted felon who’s pushing 80 with cognitive issues. I mean, let’s face it, he picked JD Vance as his vice president. This is a man who is in favor of a national abortion ban. Let me tell you this. Donald Trump, JD Vance, and their faithful followers like Sam Brown and Drew Johnson, they’re in for a rude awakening if they think they can take Nevada because I’ll tell you from personal experience, never, never count out Nevada Dems. We outwork. We outorganize. And most importantly, we outvote and that’s exactly what we’re going to do in November. Now, I got to tell you something. These Republicans think they can use fancy words, fancy plans like Project 2025.

Audience (03:27):

Boo.

Susie Lee (03:31):

And then they say, “But really, it’s really not what you think it is,” right? Do they think we’re that dumb? You all know about Project ’25. It was written by a group of think tankers, and I should know something about crazy think tankers because I’m running against one of them, Drew Johnson. They say things that literally make you scratch your head and say, “That’s not only weird. That’s just wrong.” Can I hear you say it? That’s just-

Audience (04:11):

Just wrong.

Susie Lee (04:13):

… wrong. They’ll tell you, “Abortion’s a state issue. We’re going to keep our hands off of it,” but what they’re really saying is that politicians should be allowed to ban abortion, without exceptions for rape, incest, or the life of a mother. And what do we say? That’s just-

Audience (04:36):

Wrong.

Susie Lee (04:37):

… wrong. They tell you they want to save social security, but what they’re really saying is they want to raise the retirement age and cut your hard-earned benefits by 30%. What do we say?

Audience (04:53):

That’s just wrong.

Susie Lee (04:56):

They’ll tell you they’ll cut taxes, but it’s not your taxes. It’s taxes on big corporations and ultra wealthy. And then they want to turn around and repeal the Affordable Care Act, leaving millions of Americans without health coverage. And what do we say? That’s-

Audience (05:15):

That’s just wrong.

Susie Lee (05:18):

They tell you they want better schools, but what they really are saying is they want to eliminate the Department of Education. And we say?

Audience (05:27):

That’s just wrong.

Susie Lee (05:31):

If they get their way, millions of girls and women like my daughter will lose their freedoms. LGBTQ rights will be rolled back, and working families-

Audience (05:44):

Boo.

Susie Lee (05:47):

And working families and seniors literally will be caught holding the bag, while millionaires laugh their way all the way to the bank. Let me hear it one more time. That’s just wrong.

Audience (06:03):

That’s just wrong.

Susie Lee (06:05):

Now, listen, we’re from Nevada. We’re a gambling state, but we will not gamble with our freedoms and our future. We will outwork. We will outorganize. We will outvote because we know how to deliver for the future, a future with lower housing costs, affordable child care, protecting working families and small businesses. Together, we will elect Democrats to the Assembly and the State Senate. We’re going to take back the house and make Hakeem Jeffries the speaker. We’re sending Jacky Rosen back to the Senate. And right here in this state, we will make history by electing Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. Let’s do it.

Speaker 2 (07:33):

Please welcome United States Representative Steven Horsford.

Audience (07:36):

Susie. Susie. Susie.

MUSIC (07:36):

[foreign language 00:07:37].

Steven Horsford (07:36):

Let’s go. Are you ready to win?

Audience (08:04):

Yeah.

Steven Horsford (08:07):

Let’s go win this. Good afternoon, Nevada.

Audience (08:12):

Good afternoon.

Steven Horsford (08:15):

What an incredible day to be here with all of you to welcome Vice President Kamala Harris back to Las Vegas. This is her seventh trip to the state of Nevada this year alone, but her first as our democratic nominee for president of the United States. And she’s brought a remarkable friend, Governor Tim Walz. He’s our outstanding democratic nominee for vice president. Tim or Coach, as we call him, I’ve had an opportunity to serve with him in the House. He’s an educator. He’s a veteran, and he has served our country as leading up the Veterans Affairs Committee with unwavering dedication. He’s always been a fierce advocate for working families, for veterans, for all of us. And now as our next vice president, he’s ready to take the fight to the White House.

(09:44)
Now look, democracy is a team sport, so that means that there is something that every one of us can do between now and Election Day and 87 days to win this election. We have to make sure that we get every voter out. We need to be talking to every single voter, making sure that everyone is registered, that their registration is up to date and active. We need to knock doors. We need to make every call, and we need to talk to everyone in all of our communities, Democrats, nonpartisans, and yes, Republicans too. I’m a son of an immigrant mother who came to the United States when she was 12 years old from Trinidad. My mother is one of the hardest working people I know and she’s persevered through a lot. She earned her citizenship a couple of years ago, and this will be her first election voting for president of the United States. She happens to be a constituent. I have to make sure she votes for me too.

(11:18)
Now, imagine, in January of 2025, President Harris and Vice President Walz leading the White House, with Democrats back in the majority and Hakeem Jeffries as our next speaker of the House of Representatives, maintaining the majority in the United States Senate with Jacky Rosen right here from Nevada. Together, we will push forward an agenda of economic opportunity by centering the people, the people, in the center of the policy by advancing work, wages, and wealth for everybody. We’re going to tear down the barriers that have held working families back for generations.

(12:18)
I hear you, my constituents, when you say that the rent is too damn high. That’s why I’m working to hold corporate landlords accountable. They’re buying up our homes. They’re pricing out our veterans and first-time home buyers. That has to stop now. And with Kamala Harris, she reminds us that there is hope and progress and that is possible for all of us. As we create a more perfect union, we must advance policies that uplift every American family, ensuring that we thrive, not just survive. This means that we have access to good-paying union jobs, better funded schools, and job training programs that prepare the workforce for the 21st century economy, and a tax system that rewards work, not wealth.

(13:36)
But we’re up against forces that want to drag us backwards. President Trump and my opponent, John Lee, and their Project 2025, they want to erase the progress that we’ve made and take us back. They want to strip away our right to organize or to join a union. They want to impose a national abortion ban. And they want to roll back equality, erase marriage equality, and deny civil rights protections. But guess what? We’re not going back. We’re going forward. We’re going forward. We’re not going back. We’re going forward. We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back.

Audience (14:43):

We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back.

Steven Horsford (14:51):

And we’ve seen what they will do if they have the chance to appoint more justices to the Supreme Court, but we cannot and we will not let that happen again either. We’re not going back. We’re moving forward with Kamala Harris and Coach Walz leading us forward because they’re about building up communities, not tearing them down. They’re about bringing all of us together through coalition, not dividing us. The more that we all succeed, the stronger that our nation becomes. Our economy, our communities, and our children will have the opportunity to grow and to thrive. And remember, we have to vote for Democrats up and down the ballot, up and down the ballot. So are you with me?

Audience (16:00):

Yeah.

Steven Horsford (16:00):

We’ve got 87 days, so let’s go win this. Let’s make history again, Nevada. Let’s go win.

Speaker 2 (16:12):

Please welcome United States Representative Dina Titus.

MUSIC (16:15):

[foreign language 00:16:18].

Dina Titus (16:18):

Wow. Well, welcome to District 1. How great is it to see you here right in the heart of my district? Wow, I hadn’t seen as much action in Thomas & Mack since the Runnin’ Rebels won the Final Four. This is amazing. It looks like a party, sounds like a party, acts like a party, so I’m going to take this party to the streets and elect Kamala Harris and Coach Walz. I know we can do it. You got to keep that enthusiasm going and send them to the White House.

(17:23)
This nation is right on the brink of a historic reckoning and Nevada is positioned to take the lead. Now, Nevada, we can lead this nation into the future or we can witness it falling back, falling back into the darkness of Donald Trump, when women’s rights were disregarded, minority rights were trampled, small businesses and working families were left behind, and children were sent to school hungry where they could not learn. That is not where we want to go. And as Steven said and as the vice president likes to say, we are not going back. We are not going back. We’re not going back. And if Nevada has anything to do with it, we won’t go back. Am I right?

(18:28)
Real hope and progress come from real people and that’s who Kamala Harris and Coach Walz are. They are real people. They care about real people like us. If you look at the vice president by the side of Joe Biden, she led us here in Southern Nevada to recover from COVID when we were the hardest hit area in the whole country. The investment in infrastructure, the expansion of healthcare, protecting renewable energy and expanding it, all those things affected us directly. And Tim Walz, I served with Tim in the House on the Veterans Affairs Committee, and he made a priority of veteran suicide and disability responses and benefits because he cares about the people who serve this country so bravely in uniform.

(19:32)
That’s right. That’s who real people are. You leave no soldier behind on the field. You leave no veteran behind once he comes home. And they’re not going to leave any of us behind. They’ve done an awful lot, but there’s a lot more to do. We’ve got to protect a woman’s right to choose. We’ve got to protect. We’ve got to protect the right to unionize. Absolutely. We’ve got to protect the right to vote. They’re coming after that. We got to protect Social Security and Medicare. They want to get rid of that. And in fact, we have got to protect democracy. It’s a big job, but we got broad shoulders. We can do it here in Nevada. Yes, we can. Yes, we can.

(20:42)
By the way, I’m one of those miserable, childless cat ladies. Oh, JD Vance apologized to my cat, but he had never apologized to me for what he had to say, so I got a word for JD Vance. You better hide behind that sofa because we’re coming for you. We are coming for you, JD. That’s right.

Audience (21:35):

Dina. Dina. Dina. Dina. Dina. Dina.

Dina Titus (21:36):

We’re coming for JD Vance. We’re coming for the MAGA folks. Donald Trump, we’re coming for you. Hear it loud from Nevada. We are coming for you. Let me hear you say it, so they can hear it back in Washington. We’re coming for you. We’re coming. And what a day it’s going to be. Can you just see that picture, the prosecutor versus the criminal? Thank you.

Speaker 2 (22:07):

Please welcome your United States senator from Nevada, Senator Jacky Rosen.

MUSIC (22:12):

[foreign language 00:22:13].

Audience (22:12):

Jacky. Jacky. Jacky.

Jacky Rosen (22:12):

Wow, good afternoon, Las Vegas. I know it’s heating up out there, but this race is heating up everywhere. And we’re here to welcome Vice President Kamala Harris, soon to be President Harris and soon to be Vice President Walz. And here, in the entertainment capital, sports capital, food capital, convention capital of the country, we’re going to show them how we welcome them. We’re going to show them how we welcome. We’re going to show them how we vote. That’s right. Because when we vote, we win. We’re battle-born, battleground, and battle-tested, and Vice President Harris knows that and she’s a champion for the issues that we care about. She’s a fighter. She’s a fighter for working families, for restoring reproductive freedom. Yeah. She’s a fighter. She takes on special interest to bring down costs, and she’s a fighter because she took on the epidemic of gun violence, and she fights for so much more. Kamala Harris, Vice President Harris, she has the grit. She has the determination. And she will win this race and lead our country through its toughest challenges. We’re also going to show Governor Walz that Las Vegas welcome too, right?

Audience (24:16):

Yeah.

Jacky Rosen (24:21):

Governor Walz knows a few things about leadership. He served in the Army National Guard for 24 years. He knows the importance of service. He knows the importance of advocating for our veterans, for our military families. And Governor Walz knows families and he knows kids. He’s a former social studies teacher. He’s a football coach. Hey. And although, this isn’t the football stadium, Thomas & Mack knows a few things about winning sports championships, that we host the Runnin’ Rebels. But Governor Walz knows how to talk to kids, how to work with families, and help them build up themselves and build up communities. And then he ran for Congress and he was a bipartisan member of the House of Representatives and a governor for Minnesota. He knows how to bring together Democrats, Republicans, to get the job done.

(25:24)
And Nevada, all of you here, all of you here, all of us and everyone you know, we are going to be center stage for deciding control of who’s going to win the Senate and who’s going to win the White House this November. I know I can count on all of you, so can Vice President Harris. Why can we count on you? Because there is a stark choice for Nevada voters this November. There’s a choice, a choice between a convicted criminal who’s only out for himself.

Audience (26:13):

Boo.

Jacky Rosen (26:17):

Don’t boo. Vote.

Audience (26:27):

Jacky. Jacky. Jacky. Jacky.

Jacky Rosen (26:31):

Thank you. Well, I want to tell you some more about the choices though because there’s a choice. That’s just a convicted felon, but there’s a choice because Vice President Harris is a former prosecutor and attorney general who stands up for the rule of law and takes on bad actors. And there’s a choice, a choice between extreme MAGA Republicans who want to repeal the Affordable Care Act, take away protections for preexisting conditions, or the Democrats who want to deliver lower healthcare, lower prescription drug prices. It matters. Healthcare matters.

(27:12)
And there’s a stark choice, a choice between tax breaks for the ultra-wealthy and giant corporations who are ripping us off or real tax cuts and lower costs for working families, for working families. Well, there’s still a few more choices. There’s a choice between a threat of a nationwide abortion ban or the promise, the promise of restoring Roe and protecting reproductive freedom for all. There’s a choice. There’s a choice between violence, between division and chaos, like we saw on January 6th. I was there. Trust me, they were no tourists. Or a president like Vice President Harris who knows that no one is above the law. No one is above our democracy, no one. And that our country is at its best when we stand united. So let’s be clear. We have some big challenges ahead of us. The contrast couldn’t be bigger and the stakes couldn’t be higher. Cost of living is still too high. Giant corporations driving up those costs every day. It’s why we’re taking on special interests, working to lower the cost of housing, of gas, of groceries, of everyday essentials. Yeah. I know culinary unions here. I was a member of 226 when I was a little bit younger, but we got a lot of unions here in Nevada, and we’re pushing for the PRO Act to help Nevada workers join a union, organize in their workplace, and earn a living wage.

(29:22)
We’re going to push for tax relief for tipped workers, tax cuts for the middle class, and we’re going to expand the child tax credit, the child tax credit. We’re going to keep pushing back against those extreme Republicans like my opponent, Sam Brown.

Audience (29:42):

Boo.

Jacky Rosen (29:42):

Yeah. He’s not from Nevada, but he wants to put your Social Security and your Medicare on the chopping block. Let’s be sure. And we’re going to stand up to all the extremists in Washington who overturned Roe v. Wade and the MAGA candidates like Sam Brown who we know would vote to pass a nationwide abortion ban if they have the chance. We won’t let them. We won’t go back.

Audience (30:06):

We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back.

Jacky Rosen (30:06):

That’s right.

Audience (30:06):

We’re not going back.

Jacky Rosen (30:06):

We won’t go back.

Audience (30:06):

We’re not going back.

Jacky Rosen (30:06):

We’re not going back.

Audience (30:06):

We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back.

Jacky Rosen (30:24):

We sure don’t want them to come after our IVF or our birth control either. Not going back to that. I’m going to finish up here in a minute. But our priorities, we stand in clear contrast with Donald Trump, oh, with his VP pick, JD Vance, and my extreme MAGA opponent, Sam Brown. These guys are far right out of touch and they do not understand Nevada. They do not understand Nevada. Elections are about choices, my friends. The choice is very clear. I always put Nevada first. This is my home. It’s been my home for 50 years. Sam Brown will always put MAGA first. I’ll fight for personal freedoms. My opponent has a decades-long record of wanting to take those freedoms away. And that’s the choice we make this November, and this election will also have the choice to directly defend reproductive freedom in Nevada because our rights are literally on the ballot. Don’t boo. Vote. So please vote yes on the reproductive rights amendment to permanently give Nevadans the right to reproductive healthcare.

(32:10)
And we’re going to win because I’m looking out here at all of you and I know the ones that aren’t here too, and we’re going to fight for our rights. We’re going to fight for our freedoms. We’re going to fight for our future. We need all hands on deck to get everybody out to vote to defend our Senate majority, to elect Vice President Harris and Governor Walz to the White House. I see a lot of you out here who volunteer, but I know we could always use a few more, so you can go ahead and visit rosenfornevada.com or take out your phone and text JACKY, J-A-C-K-Y, to 30508. You can get involved. You can be sure everyone you know votes and we can show everybody how Nevada

Senator Jacky Rosen (33:00):

… does it. We’ve got 87 days to go. So what are we going to do? We’re going to mobilize. What are we going to do? We’re going to organize. And what are we going to do? We’re going to vote, because when we vote, we win.

Audience (33:13):

We win.

Senator Jacky Rosen (33:14):

Thank you.

Speaker 3 (33:18):

Please welcome your United States Senator from Nevada, Senator Catherine Cortez Masto.

Jacky Rosen (33:23):

Well, hello, Las Vegas. Now, I know you’ve been saying this over and over again, but really, are we ready to welcome the next President of the United States, Kamala Harris?

Audience (34:03):

Yeah.

Jacky Rosen (34:08):

And are we ready to welcome our next Vice President, Tim Walz?

Audience (34:16):

Yeah.

Jacky Rosen (34:17):

So am I. So am I. Think about this, think about this. When my grandfather crossed the Rio Grande to come to this country for a better life for his family, he had no idea that only two generations later, his granddaughter would be the first Latina ever elected to the United States. [Foreign Language 00:34:53]. That is the American dream, right? That’s what Nevada families want for their children. And let me tell you, Kamala Harris, she understands that dream, and this is how I know. This is how I know. Vice President Harris and I met serving as Attorneys General together, and I quickly learned what kind of person she is. As Attorneys General, Kamala and I took on the big banks during the 2000 mortgage crisis, right? And I will tell you, after many phone calls and meetings with her leadership, we won $25 billion in retribution for working families across this country. So I know, showing up for all Americans, that’s Kamala Harris. That is absolutely Kamala Harris.

(35:53)
And when Kamala led a group of Attorneys General across the border to meet with our Mexican counterparts to address transnational crime, she made sure we also met with victims of human trafficking and sexual violence so that we could better understand what we were fighting for. Standing up for justice, that’s Kamala Harris. And together, we started an information sharing program with Mexico that helped us prosecute transnational criminals, drug smugglers, and human traffickers at our Southern border. Holding criminals accountable, that’s Kamala Harris.

(36:48)
So Las Vegas and Nevada, believe me when I say, Kamala Harris is a fighter for our working families, for good paying jobs, and for our freedoms. As Vice President, Kamala Harris took historic action to invest in American technology, to upgrade our infrastructure and create thousands of clean energy jobs. And by the way, we’re a proud union state here in Nevada, so those are good-paying union jobs. Those are good-paying union jobs, and Kamala Harris knows this, because she also knows what our culinary knows, that one job should be enough. It should be enough, right? Kamala Harris also knows that our families shouldn’t have to choose between paying for their medication and putting food on the table, right? That’s why she worked to cap the cost of insulin at $35 per month, and it’s why the Biden-Harris administration is forcing big pharma to negotiate lower prescription drug costs. Right? This is it. I don’t have to tell you.

(38:10)
Listen, we have made so much progress. But we’re not done. We’re not done. We know there’s more work to be done. And as President, Kamala Harris will keep us moving forward toward a future where every American has every opportunity, a future where politicians aren’t telling us what to do with our bodies, a future where we choose freedom. But you want to know who takes us backward? Donald Trump. And listen, how do we know this? Well, just read his party’s The right-wing MAGA manifesto, this Project 2025, just read it. He wants to raise taxes on the middle class and give big tax breaks to his wealthy friends. He wants to line big pharma’s pockets instead of reducing prescription drug costs for Americans across this country. He wants to cut social security and Medicare.

(39:24)
Donald Trump’s solutions, listen, he has no solutions, and that’s his problem. And I’m here to tell you, as somebody who fought for this piece of legislation, he doesn’t even want a solution to address what’s happening at the southern border, because he tanked the strongest bipartisan border security bill we have ever had. He did it intentionally. He’d rather have this chaos. And you know what else? You know what else? Donald Trump and J.D. Vance think women shouldn’t have control over their own bodies. Now, here in Nevada, we are a proud pro-choice state. But I’m here to tell you, and you all know this, there are politicians like Donald Trump and J.D. Vance who just don’t care. They just don’t care. And I’ll tell you what, he may be lying about it now, but we know that Donald Trump would sign a national abortion ban into law if he got the chance, and we just cannot give him that chance. Right?

(40:41)
So here’s what we know. That’s why we need to elect democrats up and down the ballot here in Nevada, right? That’s right. We need to win the majority in the House, we need to keep our majority in the Senate, and yes, we must win the White House. So listen, you saw them here today. We have to send Susie Lee, Dina Titus, Steven Horsford back to the House, right? And we have to send my partner, Jacky Rosen, back to the Senate. And because we want more friends in Washington, we have to elect Kamala Harris and Tim Walz as our next President and Vice President.

(41:47)
Now, Nevada, I’m going to leave you with one last thing. I’m going to leave you with one last thing. Last election, the Senate majority came down to 7,928 Nevada voters. With that number, we held the Senate, thanks to all of you. That’s less than a 1% margin. But I’m here to tell you, and you know this, it’s a reminder that every vote counts. Every vote counts. So, Nevada, are we going to make our votes count?

Audience (42:28):

Yeah.

Jacky Rosen (42:32):

Nevada, are we going to choose the prosecutor over the convicted felon?

Audience (42:41):

Yeah.

Jacky Rosen (42:41):

Nevada, are we going to deliver our state for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz?

Audience (42:47):

Yeah.

Jacky Rosen (42:47):

And as my good friend, Kamala Harris, says, “When we fight …”

Audience (42:58):

We win.

Jacky Rosen (42:59):

All right, Nevada. Thank you so much.

Keep it down on the low-key.

You should know how it feels

(01:15:36)
Hey. Hey.

(01:15:36)
I saw this shorty, she was checking up on me.

(01:15:36)
From the game she was spitting in my ear.

(01:15:36)
You would think that she knew me.

(01:15:36)
I decided to chill.

(01:15:36)
Conversation got heavy.

(01:15:36)
She had me feeling like she’s ready to blow.

(01:15:36)
Watch out.

(01:15:36)
Oh.

(01:15:36)
Watch out.

(01:15:36)
She’s saying “Come get me. Come get me.”

(01:21:06)
Let’s go.

(01:21:06)

(01:29:00)
Lightning strikes every time she moves.

(01:29:00)
And everybody’s watching her.

(01:29:00)
But she’s looking at you, ooh, ooh.

(01:29:00)

(01:32:38)
Yes, I’m let loose…

(01:32:38)
Freedom, freedom.

I can’t move.

(01:32:38)
Freedom, cut me loose.

(01:32:38)
Singing freedom, freedom.

(01:32:38)
Where are you?

(01:33:27)
‘Cause I need freedom, too.

Speaker 5 (01:33:43):

Please welcome public school teacher, Tillie Torres.

Tillie Torres (01:33:48):

Hello, Las Vegas. I am so excited to be here with all of you and also kind of nervous. Who’s excited to see the next President of The United States and Vice President? My name is Tillie Torres and I’m an English teacher, right here in Las Vegas. I’ve been teaching in Clark County for over years. I’m also a mother of three beautiful adult children and they are all teachers like me. Growing up, I always knew I wanted to be a teacher because I saw education for what it really was, The greatest instrument of social justice in this country. I grew up in Hawaii and I worked full time for most of my high school and college. I also took care of my mom, who was disabled. We were in and out of homelessness, but as a first generation college student, I needed to take out loans in order to attend university in my home state, while working two or three or four jobs, but my education unlocked opportunity for me. Opportunity that lead me to becoming a teacher right here in Las Vegas, Nevada.

(01:35:46)
Sadly, life happened. A few years after I graduated, I was diagnosed with cancer. Between fighting cancer, caring for my husband, who was injured at the time, and becoming a mom, I wasn’t able to make regular payments on those student loans for quite some time. But at 50 years old, after making those regular payments for almost 30 years on a loan of $40,000, I somehow still owed $87,000. I thought, honestly, I’d be saddled with that terrible debt for the rest of my life. And it was my daughter who told me about President Biden and Vice President Harris’ actions to fix public service loan forgiveness. I applied. I didn’t think much of it. I had zero hope. But I got to tell you, when I got that letter from the Department of Education, saying I owed zero, it was the best day of my life. The wave of relief that I felt, it’s indescribable. Because of the Biden Harris administration, for the first time, I have financial freedom.

(01:37:07)
As a teacher, I routinely tell my students the same thing I learnt growing up, that education is the key to opportunity and now, thanks to Biden Harris, I believe it too. But when I look at Donald Trump, I see someone who wants to take away the opportunities from my students and my family. His Project 2025 agenda is calling for completely eliminating the Department of Education. As a public school teacher, that’s terrifying. There could not be anything more fundamentally different between Donald Trump’s backwards vision for our America and Kamala Harris’ vision for our progress. When I look at Kamala Harris, I see someone who represents my family and understands the struggles of everyday Americans like me. She grew up the daughter of a working mother too. She even worked at McDonald’s. And in November, we, here in Nevada are going to make her the next President of The United States. That’s what America is and that’s what we stand for.

(01:38:39)
Kamala’s vision for America is an America you and I can be proud of. And let me just say, as a teacher, I could not be more excited about future Vice President, Governor Tim Walz. Couldn’t be. I

Tillie Torres (01:39:00):

I knew that Tim Walz was the man for the job. When I found out that, as a teacher, he supervised the lunchroom for 20 years. As a fellow high school teacher, all I can say is that if Governor Walz can handle a high school lunchroom for two decades and coach his football team to state championships, the vice presidency should be a piece of cake. And I know that we here in Nevada are going to do everything we can to get Kamala and Tim over the finish line. Now, I heard it’s a little cold up there in Minnesota. That’s where Tim’s from. So let’s give a record-breaking 120 degree welcome to the next Vice President of the United States, Governor Tim Walz.

MUSIC (01:39:56):

Well I was born in a small town.

(01:39:56)
And I live in a small town.

(01:39:56)
Probably die in a small town.

(01:39:56)
Oh those small communities.

(01:39:56)
All my friends are so small town.

(01:39:56)
My parents live in the same small town.

Tim Walz (01:41:00):

Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Hey. Wow. Wow. One more time for Tilly. Thank you. Well, hello, Las Vegas. Now, I know some of you spent the week Googling Minnesota a little bit and to figure out who these Minnesotans were. Here’s the one thing I can tell you about us. We spend about half our lives talking about the weather. It’s what we do. So I want to say thank you to all of the people since I’ve been here to remind me that it’s a dry heat outside. So as your oven.

(01:41:49)
But you know that’s a melting like a snowman outside. But look, this is incredible, and I want to say a thank you to a few folks I had the privilege of working with when I served in Congress. You have two of the best senators you could ever hope for.

(01:42:11)
Senator Cortez Masto and Senator Rosen, just as a side note, there’s lots of commonalities here. It may not be the weather. We walk on water half the year. It’s so damn cold. But that’s what we are. But we have something in common. Both Minnesota and Nevada have two women senators, and that’s a pretty good thing.

(01:42:35)
Huge thank you to Congressman Horsford, Congresswoman Lee, and a long-time friend I served with Congresswoman Titus. Grateful. The special thank you is for whom I’m looking at right here. To every one of you who took time out of your busy lives, you didn’t need to be here. There’s many things you could have been doing. You chose. You braved 108-degree heat. I can’t even believe I’m saying that just to be here. And I have to tell you, I understand because of the heat, they had to shut the door early and turn thousands of folks away. But don’t worry. We’re going to be back a lot. All the things, you got babysitters, you had to do everything. You came here for something bigger than yourselves for one simple, eloquent, and beautiful reason, you love this country.

Audience (01:43:39):

USA. USA. USA.

Tim Walz (01:43:39):

USA.

Audience (01:43:39):

USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA.

Tim Walz (01:43:59):

I’m so incredibly proud to be on this ticket. And I want to give a big shout-out with the support of a special group tonight, Culinary Workers Union 226.

(01:44:19)
We’re here for that love and the end of this road. Remember, 87 days, rarely in your life do you get an opportunity in 87 days to change the trajectory of not just today or tomorrow, but for generations around the world.

(01:44:41)
And I keep saying this, we can do anything for 87 days. And my mantra is, we’ll sleep when we’re dead. We’ll sleep when we’re dead, because when you wake up on that 88th day, you’re going to get say, “Welcome, Madam President Harris.” This is a leader that wakes up every day to try and do things for the American people. She took on the predators, the fraudsters, the transnational gangs, stood up against the greed of corporate interests, stood with working people in organized labor and never failed to reach across the aisle if it meant improving people’s lives.

(01:45:50)
I was taught a little something about that commitment too. I was born in a small town in Nebraska where community was a way alive. There’s some Nebraskans in the house. [inaudible 01:46:02] You think I’m kidding. You think I’m kidding, 400 people, 25 kids in my class, 12 were cousins. That’s small town. That’s small town. But you know what? My parents and my community taught me generosity towards my neighbor and to work for the common good. My dad was a chain-smoking Korean War era veteran who two days after my 17th birthday took me down to sign up to join the National Guard.

(01:46:36)
I was proud for the next 24 years to wear the uniform of this country. Thank you to every single one of you wore that uniform. And I’ll have to tell you, like my dad before me and millions of others, the GI Bill gave me a shot at a college education.

(01:46:59)
And just like Tilly, my dad was a teacher. My older brother was a teacher. My sister was a teacher. My younger brother was a teacher. And we married teachers. So the privilege of my lifetime was spending two decades teaching in public schools. And you might’ve heard coaching football to a state championship.

Audience (01:47:34):

[inaudible 01:47:41].

Tim Walz (01:47:50):

Don’t ever close that yearbook. That’s my pro-tip. Look, my students and my players are the ones who encouraged me to run for office. They saw in me what I hoped to instill in them, a commitment to a common good and something so important, the belief as each and every one of you came here as a single person, a single person can make a difference, can make a difference.

(01:48:19)
Never planned my life to run for office, but I think my life prepared me well. And when my neighbors asked if I’d run for office, I was pretty clueless. I did not know that the district I was running in it only had one Democrat since 1892 before me.

(01:48:35)
But my community graced me with the opportunity to represent them in the United States Congress for 12 years where I had the privilege of serving as the ranking member on the VA committee, working with Republicans to pass the most extensive veterans package since the GI Bill. I learned the art of compromising without compromising my values.

(01:49:05)
And as now as governor, I bring all those experience together to tackle the most pressing challenges we have in the great state of Minnesota.

(01:49:14)
Now, each of you came here. You came here because you love the country. You came here because you know how fantastic leader is going to walk out those doors in a minute or two, the person that you see bringing everything to us. But just be very clear here, Donald Trump sees the world very differently than all of us here. Each of you talk about service. Donald Trump knows nothing about service.

Audience (01:49:48):

[inaudible 01:49:44] We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back.

Tim Walz (01:49:49):

It’s pretty hard to provide service to others when you’re too busy looking out for only yourself. Again and again and again, Donald Trump made decisions to weaken this country, to strengthen his own hand. He mocked our laws. He sowed division and chaos amongst our citizens. And that’s to say nothing of his record as president.

(01:50:15)
He froze in the face of the global COVID pandemic, and our neighbors died because of it. By not addressing COVID, he drove our economy into the ground. And I just want to set the record straight because facts do matter, and there’s not an alternate set of facts. Here’s one for you.

(01:50:47)
Violent crime was up during the Trump presidency, and that’s even not counting his crimes. Some of you gray hair or no hairs in here can actually remember a time when Republicans actually talked about freedom and believed in it. Not these guys. These are the guys that believe government should be free to invade your exam room with your doctor.

(01:51:20)
I’m sure it’s true here in Nevada, as it’s true in Minnesota. We respect our neighbor’s rights to make their own personal choices. We don’t have to agree with them or make the same choice, but we know that this nation things work best when you mind your own damn business, you mind your own business.

(01:51:46)
I don’t need any help. I don’t need any help from those guys telling me which books to read. I sure the heck don’t need any lecture about morality from those guys. And the last thing, they can mind their own businesses, I don’t need any help from them talking about my family.

(01:52:21)
And this is where it gets personal, where they want to dictate things like IVF and reproductive care. I know there’s a lot of you out there, this is the most personal choices we have. When my wife and I decided to have children, we spent years going through fertility treatments. We have somebody to help. You have water?

Audience (01:52:44):

We need a medic.

Tim Walz (01:52:45):

All right. Thanks for helping your neighbors. You’re welcome. You good? Thank you. Sure. I remember those waiting for the phone calls. You’d go through the treatments. I would have my neighbor come over to have to give shots to my wife and things like that.

(01:53:02)
And the phone would ring and you would just hope so highly that it would be good news. And then when you found out the treatments didn’t work, it was a darkness that could blot out the sun. So I have to tell you, it wasn’t by chance when that phone call finally came, and we found out we were going to welcome our daughter into the world.

(01:53:23)
We named her the most powerful word in the universe, Hope. Hope. So when you hear Kamala Harris and I talk about freedom, we’re very clear about this. We mean the freedom to make your own healthcare decisions and that your children should be free to go to school without worrying about being shot dead in their classroom. Look, again, I know Nevada is a lot like Minnesota. In Minnesota, we believe in the Second Amendment.

Audience (01:54:19):

Yeah.

Tim Walz (01:54:21):

But we also believe in common-sense gun violence laws. Vice President Harris believes education should be a ticket to the middle class, not crippling student loan debt. And we come here today because in 87 days, we’re going to settle our political differences, not through violence. We’re going to settle it by beating them at the ballot box. So, look, I keep saying this, this is a pretty simple thing here. This election’s about the choice, about what direction this country will go in. And I want to be clear, I know very clearly that I am preaching to the choir, but here’s my words for you. The choir needs to sing. The choir needs to sing.

(01:55:20)
So the other day, I was saying this, I started out by saying, “Don’t believe Donald Trump when he plays dumb about 2025.” But then I remembered you don’t believe him on anything because that’s what you shouldn’t believe. But, look, I coached football for enough years. When somebody draws up a playbook, they plan on using it. And when they do, they’ll restrict our freedoms. When they do, they’ll do what they’ve done. They’ll rig the economy so that the middle class gets nothing, and the rich get richer. If this guy gets an opportunity again, he won’t only pick up where he left off. It will be much worse than it was last time. He’ll gut social security, pull your healthcare, underfund public schools, all of it.

Audience (01:56:20):

We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back.

Tim Walz (01:56:21):

That’s damn right, damn right. We’re not going back.

Speaker 6 (01:56:23):

We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back.

Tim Walz (01:56:37):

Look, this guy’s not fighting for you or your family. He doesn’t give a damn. And his running mate shares his dangerous and backward agenda.

Speaker 6 (01:56:44):

[inaudible 01:56:46].

Tim Walz (01:56:46):

I said this, all of my friends, we went to Yale, had billionaires fund our career. And then we write a book trashing our neighbors that raised us. Come on. We’re better than that. We’re better than that. And I said it, I want to be clear. I didn’t call anybody names. I spent enough years in that lunchroom to know bullies when I see them.

(01:57:07)
I just made a very clear observation that they seem to be really concerned about. I pointed out that taking away reproductive freedoms, banning books, raising the price of insulin, trying to hurt labor unions, nobody’s asking for that weird crap. No one’s asking for it. Here’s the good news. We do the work. This is about the future. We do the work. None of that’s going to happen. Vice President Harris believes in those freedoms. She knows that every single person should get a chance at the middle class. She believes in something so beautiful, the promise of America. It’s that simple, the promise of America.

(01:57:58)
Madam Vice President, I want to say thank you for putting the trust in me to be your running mate. And I want to say she has done so much. And with you together, it’s reminded us about something. It’s reminded us that this work can be about goodness. It can be about smiling. It’s tough work, but we can be happy doing it. And Kamala Harris has done something that we’d forever be grateful for her. She has brought out the joy in our politics. Nevada, join me in welcoming the next President of the United States, Kamala Harris.

MUSIC (01:58:53):

Telling these tears go and fall away fall away.

(01:58:54)
May the last one burn into flames.

(01:58:54)
Freedom freedom I can’t move.

(01:58:54)
Freedom cut me loose singin’.

(01:58:54)
Freedom freedom where are you?

(01:58:54)
‘Cause I need freedom too.

(01:58:54)
I break chains all by myself.

(01:58:54)
Won’t let my freedom rot in hell.

(01:58:54)
Hey, I’ma keep running.

(01:58:54)
‘Cause a winner don’t quit on themselves.

Kamala Harris (01:59:40):

Hey, Nevada. Can we hear it for Tim Walz? Oh, it’s so good to be back. Good evening, everyone. Good evening. Good evening. Oh, I see lots of friends. Oh, it is good to be back. It is good to be back. Thank you all. My goodness.

(02:00:13)
But seriously, isn’t Tim Walz fantastic? And I know for some folks you’re just getting to know him and you’ve heard he’s had many titles over his life, governor, congressman, dad, husband, coach. But in 87 days, our nation is going to know Coach Walz as Vice President of the United States of America. That’s right.

(02:00:51)
And it is so good to be here with so many incredible leaders, including my dear friends, Catherine Cortez Masto, Senator Jacky Rosen who we will reelect to the United States Senate, Congress members, Dina Titus, Steven Horsford and Susie Lee. And I know Culinary 226 is in the house.

Audience (02:01:37):

226, 226, 226, 226, 226, 226, 226, 226.

Kamala Harris (02:01:55):

And the Culinary Union, as everyone in Nevada knows, they have helped lead the way in our country for workers’ rights and workers’ dignity. And I have to say, for years, I’ve been so proud to work by your side. When I was attorney general of California, we worked together to crack down on wage theft.

(02:02:19)
When I was the United States senator, we fought together for paid family leave and medical leave. And earlier this year, right here in Vegas, we celebrated your historic contract win. And it is my promise to everyone here when I am president, we will continue our fight for working families of America, including to raise the minimum wage and eliminate taxes on tips for service and hospitality workers. And Nevada today, I also bring greetings from our incredible president, Joe Biden. Joe.

Audience (02:03:22):

We love Joe.

Kamala Harris (02:03:22):

We love Joe.

Audience (02:03:22):

We love Joe. We love Joe. We love Joe. We love Joe. We love Joe.

Kamala Harris (02:03:37):

That’s great. And I’m going to tell him what y’all just said. And I know we are all so deeply grateful to Joe Biden for his lifetime of service to our nation. And he’s not done. And he’s not done. So as I said, it’s so good to be back in Las Vegas. The last time I was here, I stopped by the practice for the men’s national basketball team before they headed out to the Olympics. And maybe you saw it on your phone. But just a few hours ago in Paris, they won the gold.

Audience (02:04:16):

[inaudible 02:04:17].

Kamala Harris (02:04:16):

And I got more for you. A few hours before that, our women’s national soccer team won the gold as well.

Audience (02:04:39):

USA. USA. USA.

Kamala Harris (02:04:39):

USA. USA.

Audience (02:04:39):

USA. USA.

Kamala Harris (02:04:57):

That’s great. So in one sport after another, Team USA continues to make our nation proud. So much to celebrate, so much to celebrate. So Nevada, we have 87 days until the election, 87 days. And here’s the thing.

Audience (02:05:21):

[inaudible 02:05:25].

Kamala Harris (02:05:29):

But here’s the thing, here’s the thing. We know this will be a tight race until the very end. And so let’s not pay too much attention to the polls because we have some hard work ahead of us, but we like hard work. Hard work is good work. And with your help this November, we will win. We will win. We will win. We will win.

Audience (02:05:56):

We will win. We will win.

Kamala Harris (02:06:09):

And I know we are all clear toward that win. We are all clear about what we are up against. As many of you know, before I was elected vice president, before I was elected a United States senator, I was an elected attorney general and before that, district attorney. And before that, I was state courtroom prosecutor.

(02:06:44)
In those roles, in those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds, predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, scammers who broke the rules for personal gain. So Nevada, hear me when I say I know Donald Trump’s type. I know.

(02:07:11)
Well, well, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. The court’s going to take care of that. We’re just going to beat him in November. We’ll beat him in November. We’ll beat him in November. But I’ve certainly been dealing with people like him my entire career. For example, as Attorney General California, I took on one of our country’s largest for-profit colleges that scammed students.

(02:07:50)
Well, Donald Trump ran a for-profit college that scammed students. Remember that. As a prosecutor, I specialized in cases of sexual abuse. Well, Donald Trump was found liable for committing sexual abuse. As attorney general, I held Wall Street Banks accountable for fraud. Well, Donald Trump was just found guilty of fraud, 34 counts.

(02:08:43)
All of this is to say, in this campaign, I will proudly put my record against his every day of the week, every day of the week. That being said, let’s make no mistake. This campaign is not just about us versus Donald Trump. It is about two different visions for our nation.

Audience (02:09:16):

That’s right.

Kamala Harris (02:09:18):

One, ours focused on the future. The other focused on the past.

Audience (02:09:27):

We’re not going back. We’re not going back.

Kamala Harris (02:09:27):

We’re not going back.

Audience (02:09:27):

We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back.

Kamala Harris (02:09:27):

We’re not going back. We are not going back.

Audience (02:09:27):

We’re not going back. We’re not going back.

Kamala Harris (02:09:44):

And we’re not going back because Nevada, we fight for the future, a future with affordable healthcare, affordable child care, and paid leave. We fight for a future where we build a broad-based economy where every American has an opportunity to own a home, to start a business, and to build wealth.

(02:10:22)
We believe in a future where we lower the cost of living for America’s families so they have a chance not just to get by, but to get ahead, to get ahead, because, look, while our economy is doing well by many measures, prices for everyday things like groceries are still too high. You know it, and I know it. When I was attorney general, I went after price-fixing schemes. And when I am president, I will continue that work to bring down prices.

(02:11:05)
I will take on big corporations that engage in illegal price gouging, corporate landlords that unfairly raise rents on working families, and take on big pharma and cap the cost of prescription drugs for all Americans. Unlike Donald Trump, I will always, I promise you, put the middle class and working families first because you see, Tim Walz and I may not appear to have a whole lot in common, but we have so much in common. And I’ll tell you what he and I

Kamala Harris (02:12:00):

… he and I know the middle class built the United States of America. And when the middle class is strong, America is strong.

(02:12:13)
And so while we together work to move our nation forward, Donald Trump has a different plan. Just look at his Project 2025 agenda, which I keep saying I can’t believe they put that in writing. So if he is elected, Donald Trump intends to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations. He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare, and he intends to surrender our fight against the climate crisis. And I don’t need to tell Nevada every day because you feel the impact of extreme heat and drought.

(02:13:17)
You know the climate crisis is real. But Donald Trump, well he claims it’s a hoax. And on top of this, if Donald Trump were to win in November, he won’t. But if he were to win in November, he intends to end the Affordable Care Act. Think about that. To take us back to a time when insurance companies had the power to deny people with pre-existing conditions. You remember what that was like? Children with asthma, breast cancer survivors, grandparents with diabetes.

(02:14:05)
Look, America has tried these failed policies before and we are not going back.

Audience (02:14:14):

Going back.

Kamala Harris (02:14:27):

We are not going back. We are not going back. We’re not going back.

Audience (02:14:27):

We’re not going back.

Kamala Harris (02:14:27):

We’re not going back.

Audience (02:14:27):

We’re not going back.

Kamala Harris (02:14:27):

We’re not going back.

Audience (02:14:27):

We’re not going back.

Kamala Harris (02:14:27):

We’re not going back.

Audience (02:14:27):

We’re not going back. We’re not going back. We’re not going back.

Kamala Harris (02:14:37):

No. And we are going to move forward. We will move forward. And in moving forward, we will take on the biggest issues facing our nation. For example, we will address the issue of immigration.

(02:14:58)
I was the attorney of a border state, attorney general of a border state. I went after transnational gangs, drug cartels, and human traffickers who came into our country illegally. I prosecuted them in case after case and I won.

(02:15:18)
We know our immigration system is broken and we know what it takes to fix it. Comprehensive reform that includes yes, strong border security and an earned pathway to citizenship.

(02:15:43)
But Donald Trump don’t want to fix this problem. He talks a big game about a lot of things, but he talks a big game about border security, but he does not walk the walk. Earlier this year, we had a chance to pass the toughest bipartisan board of security bill in decades. But Donald Trump tanked the bill because he thought it would help him win an election.

(02:16:18)
Well, when I am president, I will sign that bill into law. Nevada, ours is a fight for the future and it is a fight for freedom. Across our nation we have been witnessing a full-on assault on hard-won, hard-fought freedoms and fundamental rights, the freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe from gun violence, the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride, and the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do, a fight for freedom.

(02:17:29)
And on that last point, we all know how we got here. When he was President, Donald Trump hand-picked three members of the United States Supreme Court because he intended for them to undo the protections of Roe v. Wade. And as he intended, they did. Now, in more than 20 states, there is a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions, even for rape and incest.

(02:18:08)
And be sure if he were to win, he would sign a national abortion ban, which would outlaw abortion in every state, even Nevada. But we are not going to let that happen because we trust women.

(02:18:34)
And when I am President of the United States and Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedoms, I will sign it into law. So I know the folks who are here. I know the people of Nevada. You are battle-born. You are battle-born. And if Donald Trump wants to pick a fight over our most fundamental freedoms, we say bring it on. Bring it on. Bring it on.

Audience (02:19:27):

Bring it on. Bring it on. Bring it on. Bring it on. Bring it on. Bring it on. Bring it on. Bring it on.

Kamala Harris (02:19:27):

‘Cause we’re ready.

Audience (02:19:27):

Bring it on.

Kamala Harris (02:19:46):

We’re ready.

Audience (02:19:46):

Bring it on. Bring it on. Bring it on.

Kamala Harris (02:19:51):

So Nevada, generations, generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom. Now the baton is in our hands, each and every one of us. So we who believe in the sacred freedom to vote will finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act.

(02:20:28)
And we who believe in the freedom to live safe from gun violence will finally pass an assault weapons ban, universal background checks and red flag laws.

(02:20:47)
So much is on the line. So much is on the line in this election. And understand, this is not 2016. This is not 2020. This time around the stakes are even higher. And that’s because last month the Supreme Court of the United States basically told the former President that going forward he will effectively be immune no matter what he does in the White House. But think about what that means. Think about what that means. So Donald Trump has vowed to be a dictator on day one if re-elected. He said he will weaponize essentially the Department of Justice against his political enemies, and even called for the “termination” of the Constitution of the United States.

(02:22:06)
Let us be very clear. Someone who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again stand behind the seal of President of the United States. Never again.

Audience (02:22:34):

USA. USA. USA. USA. USA.

Kamala Harris (02:22:34):

That’s right.

Audience (02:22:34):

USA.

Kamala Harris (02:22:34):

That’s right.

Audience (02:22:34):

USA.

Kamala Harris (02:22:34):

That’s right.

Audience (02:22:34):

USA.

Kamala Harris (02:22:34):

That’s right.

Audience (02:22:34):

USA. USA. USA.

Kamala Harris (02:22:54):

We know what we stand for as Americans. And it all comes down to this. We are here together because we love our country. We love our country. And I do believe it is the highest form of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country. That is how we preserve the promise of America.

(02:23:29)
And think about it. After all, the promise of America is what makes it possible for Tim Waltz and me to be together on this stage today. Think about that. Think about that. Think about it. Two middle-class kids. One, a daughter of Oakland, California who was raised by a working mother. I had a summer job at McDonald’s. The other, a son of the Nebraska Plains who grew up working on a farm. Think about it. Think about it. Only in America is it possible that the two of them would be running together all the way to the White House. Only in America. Only in America.

(02:24:42)
So look, and I love you back. I love you back. So look, we are together. We are running this campaign on behalf of all Americans, from red states to blue states, from the heartland to the coast. And when elected, we will govern on behalf of all Americans. All Americans.

(02:25:22)
So Nevada ultimately in this election, I believe we each face a question, what kind of country do we want to live in? A country of chaos, fear and hate, or a country of freedom, compassion and rule of law.

(02:25:51)
And the beauty. And the beauty of our democracy. Here’s the thing, the beauty of our democracy is we each, each person has the power. Each person has the power to answer that question. The power is with the people. The power is with the people. It’s with the people.

(02:26:26)
And so in the next 87 days, we need you to use your power to knock on doors, register folks to vote, and make your voices heard.

(02:26:57)
So Nevada, today I ask you, are you ready to make your voices heard?

Audience (02:27:02):

Yeah.

Kamala Harris (02:27:02):

Do we believe in freedom?

Audience (02:27:06):

Yeah.

Kamala Harris (02:27:09):

Do we believe in opportunity?

Audience (02:27:15):

Yeah.

Kamala Harris (02:27:15):

Do we believe in the promise of America?

Audience (02:27:17):

Yeah.

Kamala Harris (02:27:17):

And are we ready to fight for it?

Audience (02:27:21):

Yeah.

Kamala Harris (02:27:25):

And when we fight, we win.

Audience (02:27:27):

We win.

Kamala Harris (02:27:29):

God bless you. God bless the United States of America.

Ooh yeah.

Ah-ha. Yeah.

(02:35:35)
I wanna dance.

(02:35:35)
Clock strikes upon the hour.

(02:35:35)
And the sun begins to fade.

(02:35:35)
Still enough time to figure out.

(02:35:35)
How to chase my blues away.

(02:35:35)
I’ve done alright up ’till now.

(02:35:35)
It’s the light of day that shows me how.

(02:35:35)
And when the night falls, loneliness calls. Oh, I wanna dance with somebody.

(02:36:36)
I wanna feel the heat with somebody.

(02:36:36)
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody.

(02:36:36)
With somebody who loves me.

(02:36:36)
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody.

I wanna feel the heat with somebody.

(02:36:36)
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody.

(02:36:36)
With somebody who loves me.

(02:36:36)
I’ve been in love and lost my senses.

(02:36:36)
Spinning through the town.

(02:36:36)
Sooner or later, the fever ends.

(02:36:36)
And I wind up feeling down.

(02:36:36)
I need a man who’ll take the chance.

(02:36:36)
On a love that burns hot enough to last.

(02:36:36)
So when the night falls.

(02:36:36)
My lonely heart calls.

(02:36:36)
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody.

(02:36:36)
I wanna feel the heat with somebody.

(02:43:27)
That’s the moment I shine.

(02:43:27)
‘Cause every romance shakes and it bends.

(02:43:27)
Don’t give a damn.

(02:43:27)
When the night’s here, I don’t do tears.

(02:43:27)
Baby, no chance.

(02:43:27)
I could dance, I could dance, I could dance.

(02:43:27)
Watch me dance, dance the night away.

My heart could be burnin’, but you won’t see it on my face.

Watch me dance, dance the night away.

(02:43:27)

When my heart breaks, they never see it, never see it.

(02:43:27)
When my world shakes, I feel alive, I feel alive.

(02:43:27)
I don’t play it safe.

(02:43:27)
Don’t you know about me.

(02:43:27)
I could dance, I could dance, I could dance.

(02:43:27)
Even when the tears are flowin’ like diamonds on my face.

I’ll still keep the party goin’, not one hair out of place.

(02:43:27)
Yes, I can.

(02:43:27)
Even when the tears are flowin’ like diamonds on my face.

(02:43:27)
Yes, I can, yes, I can.
