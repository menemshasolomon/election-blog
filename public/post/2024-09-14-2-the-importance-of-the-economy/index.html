<p>Many scholars argue that most presidential elections are determined by political and economic conditions called fundamentals, which exist outside of campaign efforts by either party. Factors like economic growth, disposable income, inflation, and the cost of living, which are often economic circumstances of the previous administration, are found to be highly correlated with election outcomes. This phenomenon is known as retrospective economic voting, wherein a voter makes choices based on the incumbent&rsquo;s past performance, with a specific focus on the economy <a href="https://hollis.harvard.edu/permalink/f/1s5nto6/01HVD_ALMA512397392810003941">Achen and Bartels, 2017</a>.</p>
<p>To evaluate this correlation it is important to look at the relationship between different economic indicators and two-party vote. In doing so, I will be focusing on economic data from quarter 2, the financial reporting quarter right before the election. This echoes the assumption embedded within retrospective voting that a vast majority of American voters only begin paying attention to the election in the months leading up to November, rewarding or punishing incumbent candidates and/or parties based on recent economic conditions <a href="https://hollis.harvard.edu/permalink/f/1s5nto6/01HVD_ALMA512397392810003941">Achen and Bartels, 2017</a>.</p>
