      <description>&lt;p&gt;##How competitive are presidential elections in the United States?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In order to predict the outcome of the 2024 presidential election, it is important to base the prediction model on an understanding of past elections at the national level.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generally speaking, national elections have been competitive between the two major parties since the election of President Roosevelt in 1948.&lt;/strong&gt; In the succeeding 75+ years, neither party has been able to maintain significant control over the White House.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;XMin&lt;/strong&gt; is the first Hugo theme I have designed. The original reason that I wrote it was I needed a minimal example of Hugo themes when I was writing the  &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;blogdown&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; book. Basically I wanted a simple theme that supports a navigation menu, a home page, other single pages, lists of pages, blog posts, categories, tags, and RSS. That is all. Nothing fancy. In terms of CSS and JavaScript, I really want to keep them minimal. In fact, this theme does not contain any JavaScript code at all, although on this example website I did introduce some JavaScript code (still relatively simple anyway). The theme does not contain any images, either, and is pretty much a plain-text theme.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
