## What is the advantage of incumbency in presidential elections?

**There have been 18 presidential elections since World War II, eleven of which had at least one incumbent president running, seven of whom won re-election.** Indeed, while an incumbent president has won re-election in 33% of the elections post WWII, the incumbent party has won over 44% of such presidential elections. These results point out a reality within U.S. politics: that incumbency is a major advantage for both politicians and parties within the context of a general election for President. 

**How many incumbent presidents have been r-elected since WWII? How many incumbent parties?**

|Was the incumbent president re-elected | Count| Percent|
|:--------------------------------------|-----:|-------:|
|FALSE                                  |    12|   66.67|
|TRUE                                   |     6|   33.33|



|Was the incumbent party re-elected | Count| Percent|
|:----------------------------------|-----:|-------:|
|FALSE                              |    10|   55.56|
|TRUE                               |     8|   44.44|

## Historically, why do incumbents have this advantage?

As seen above, incumbency presents a huge advantage for both presidents and their parties within general presidential elections. Scholar AG Cuzan 

## Can incumbency build a predictive model?

## Using this model, can we predit the results of the 2024 presidential election?
