Andre Dickens (00:00):

Honored that to welcome our Vice President Kamala Harris. And I am especially honored to welcome Vice President Harris during her 15th visit to the state of Georgia since taking office. And she is leading the Democratic Party on to victory in November. So I know we’re all excited, but I wanted to start by expressing my deepest gratitude to President Joe Biden for his tireless devotion. For his tireless devotion to our state and to our country. Throughout his entire career, president Joe Biden has always put this country first, and he’s consistently delivered for Georgia’s families. So from all of us in Georgia, once again, thank you President Biden.

(01:09)
Now, as President Biden made it clear, there’s no one better prepared to lead our nation forward than our Vice President, Kamala Harris. As a former district attorney, as an attorney general, as a a United States Senator, and now, as Vice President, Kamala Harris has proven she’s prepared to prosecute the case against Donald J. Trump. I mean, who better take on a convicted felon than a prosecutor? So Georgia, we must be clear that Donald Trump and J.D. Vance’s extreme Project 2025 is a direct threat to Georgia family.

Crowd (02:09):

Boo.

Andre Dickens (02:14):

Boo. They want to pass a national abortion ban.

Crowd (02:17):

Boo.

Andre Dickens (02:20):

They want to raise taxes on working families.

Crowd (02:23):

Boo.

Andre Dickens (02:23):

And they want to make it harder for us to vote.

Crowd (02:23):

Boo.

Andre Dickens (02:30):

But we want a brighter future than that. We want a future that our next president, Kamala Harris is going to deliver.

Crowd (02:36):

Yeah.

Andre Dickens (02:36):

Vice President Harris believes in our sacred freedoms. She believes in a country where reproductive freedoms are protected, and she is fighting for a future that our communities can do more than just get by, a future where we can get ahead. So Atlanta, so Georgia, are you ready to make history again?

Crowd (03:00):

Yeah.

Andre Dickens (03:00):

I said Georgia, are you ready to make history again?

Crowd (03:00):

Yeah.

Speaker 1 (04:12):

So Let’s elect President Kamala Harris. Let’s get it done. Thank you Atlanta. Everybody keep it going for Mayor Andre Dickens. I think he warmed us up. I want to see those signs in the air. Put them up. Put them up. I want to see the signs in the air. Put them up. Put them up. Who we voting for y’all? Harris. Harris.

Crowd (04:12):

Harris. Harris.

Speaker 1 (04:17):

Ah yeah. I will try to keep that energy as she proudly serves Georgia’s 5th District. She is ready to go. She is all smiles and she is fired up. Help me welcome Congresswoman, Nikema Williams.

Nikema Williams (04:31):

Hello, hello, hello, Atlanta. Y’all, I am Congresswoman Nikema Williams and I proudly represent you in Georgia’s fighting 5th Congressional District. I’m also proud to serve as your Chairwoman of the Democratic Party of Georgia. But y’all, I am even more proud that today on my birthday, I get to be with you, and I get to welcome the next President of the United States back to the Peach State. Y’all, she’s been here fighting for our reproductive freedom. She’s been here to show off the thousands of jobs that the Biden-Harris Administration has created in every corner of our state, fighting for our freedom to thrive, to highlight historic investments in our incredible HBCUs. She’s been her fighting for our freedom to vote, to advocate for gun safety reforms that will save lives. And now y’all, she’s back again to remind us what’s at stake in the most important election of our lives. But more importantly, she’s here to remind us of why we’re going to win. Because you might remember back in 2020, Donald Trump just couldn’t accept that Georgians rejected his extreme agenda of rolling back our freedoms and selling out working families. So he tried to silence our voices and overturn a free and fair election. But y’all, not only is he still a loser in Georgia, but now he’s a 34 count convicted felon. So I don’t know about y’all, but I’m ready to make him a loser in Georgia again. Y’all, we have a clear choice in this election. Do we want the candidate who is hell-bent on ripping away our freedoms, or the candidate fighting to restore our freedoms?

Crowd (06:50):

Yeah.

Nikema Williams (06:50):

Do we want the candidate who attacks our democracy, or the candidate who defends our freedom to vote?

Crowd (06:58):

Yeah.

Nikema Williams (06:58):

Do we want the 34 count convicted felon, or the prosecutor who holds guys like him accountable?

Crowd (07:08):

Yeah.

Nikema Williams (07:08):

Y’all, we’ve got 98 days to send Vice President Harris to the White House. This is battleground Georgia, where every single vote counts. So we’ve got a big task ahead of us, but y’all, we’re Georgia Democrats, so we know a little something about beating the odds and making history. But I have one question for you, Georgia Democrats, are y’all ready to do this?

Crowd (07:34):

Yeah.

Nikema Williams (07:34):

Are y’all ready to vote? Are you ready to fight for our victory? Because when we fight, we win.

Crowd (07:43):

We win.

Nikema Williams (07:43):

When we fight, we win.

Crowd (07:43):

We win.

Nikema Williams (07:43):

Thank you y’all.

Speaker 1 (08:06):

You heard it from Congresswoman Nikema Williams. Every vote counts. One more time for our Georgia Congresswoman. Georgia, you can’t break our soul. We Georgia, we’re the Peach State. Matter of fact, we’re going to keep this thing going right now. Pretty talented DJ. I’m ready to have a funky good time. Are you?

Crowd (08:12):

Yeah.

Speaker 1 (08:13):

I need everybody ready because this is going all over the world. You all start clapping your hands, I want blue signs in the air for our dream team, our dynamic duo, our Senator John Ossoff and Reverend Raphael Warnock. Ah yeah, keep it going, keep it going, keep it going.

John Ossoff (08:24):

Let’s go. Let’s go.

Speaker 1 (08:24):

Ossoff, Warnock. Ossoff, Warnock. Ossoff, Warnock.

Crowd (08:24):

Ossoff, Warnock. Ossoff, Warnock.

John Ossoff (08:24):

Hello Atlanta. Atlanta.

Crowd (08:24):

Yeah. Yeah.

John Ossoff (08:24):

Atlanta.

Crowd (08:24):

Yeah.

John Ossoff (08:24):

Atlanta, are you ready to elect Kamala Harris the next President of the United States?

Crowd (08:24):

Yeah.

John Ossoff (09:53):

We are so happy to be here with you tonight, Atlanta. We’re so honored to serve you, and so pleased to join you. And you know on the plane down here, Senator Warnock and I were talking about this. Don’t know if y’all heard about it, but apparently Donald Trump is too scared to debate the vice president.

Crowd (10:17):

Boo.

John Ossoff (10:17):

Too scared.

Crowd (10:31):

Boo. Too scared, too scared, too scared, too scared, too scared, too scared, too scared.

John Ossoff (10:51):

Now, I don’t know, I don’t know if y’all remember this from back in 2020, but I know about having an opponent who’s too scared to debate. And let me tell you, Atlanta, the candidate dodging debates is the candidate who is losing. Right now, Donald Trump is imagining how it will feel to stand up facing a formidable, prepared, tough as nails prosecutor, U.S. Senator, Vice President of the United States. He’s not prepared to defend his record because he cannot defend his record. Atlanta can he defend overturning Roe v. Wade?

Crowd (11:45):

No.

John Ossoff (11:49):

Can he defend disparaging and belittling American veterans and POWs?

Crowd (11:54):

No.

John Ossoff (11:57):

Can he defend being found liable by a jury for sexual abuse?

Crowd (12:03):

No.

John Ossoff (12:05):

Can he defend raising a mob that attacked the U.S. Capitol?

Crowd (12:09):

No.

John Ossoff (12:11):

Can he defend trying to discard the votes of millions of Americans?

Crowd (12:36):

No. Lock him up. Lock him up. Lock him up. Lock him up. Lock him up. Lock him up.

John Ossoff (12:36):

When the former president tried to discard the votes of American citizens, that was a direct attack on the right to vote. And Congressman Lewis reminded us when he told us about Bloody Sunday. March 7th, 1965, Selma Alabama, the height of the struggle for voting rights. John Lewis, just 25 years old, just 25 years old. And 500 strong they marched down Highway 80 from Selma toward Montgomery till they reached the Edmund Pettus Bridge, and then into a wall of state troopers, billy clubs and tear gas. The congressmen and Amelia Boynton, and dozens more beaten unconscious. They broke his skull for daring to demand the right to vote. They didn’t just march, they risked their lives fighting for a future where no matter the color of our skin, every citizen could vote. Every citizen.

(13:55)
Well, Georgia, you have proven again and again the power of your vote, even when they’ve counted it out. They said that we couldn’t win. But then three years ago, you picked me up and you picked Raphael up and you carried us on your shoulders.

Crowd (14:27):

Yeah.

John Ossoff (14:27):

And when the whole nation looked to Georgia, you elected to the U.S. Senate, a Black pastor who holds Dr. King’s pulpit at Ebenezer Baptist Church and a young Jewish son of an immigrant to represent you in the United States Senate. You did that Georgia. Well, Georgia, in three months, the whole nation will look to us again, and we will elect Kamala Harris the next President of the United States.

(15:02)
Donald Trump and J.D. Vance.

Crowd (15:09):

Boo.

John Ossoff (15:16):

These are strange men with dangerous ideas. Maya Angelou said, ” When someone shows you who they are… ”

Crowd (15:33):

Believe them.

John Ossoff (15:37):

“Believe them the first time.” Believe them the first time. Georgia, once again, it’s up to us to ensure there’s no second time. So Georgia, are you ready to work?

Crowd (15:57):

Yeah.

John Ossoff (15:57):

Georgia, are you ready to win?

Crowd (15:59):

Yeah.

John Ossoff (16:01):

Say this with me now. Say vote.

Crowd (16:03):

Vote.

John Ossoff (16:03):

Say, vote.

Crowd (16:03):

Vote.

John Ossoff (16:03):

Say vote.

Crowd (16:03):

Vote.

John Ossoff (16:07):

And now get on your feet and welcome my brother, my colleague, my friend. Your senator, the Reverend Raphael Warnock.

Raphael Warnock (16:44):

Well. Hello Georgia. Listen, I can’t do anything about the mic. We are glad to welcome to the great state of Georgia, the next President of the United States of America, Kamala Harris.

(17:25)
And I’m so glad to be here with all of you, and I’m grateful to be here with my brother from another mother, John Ossoff. Look at us and know what the whole nation knows. That when America was in trouble, during the dark days of COVID-19, and those who were pushing the destructive logic of another virus, I call COVID 1619. When there were those who are trying to divide us, because that’s what people do who do not have vision, they traffic in division, they don’t know how to lead us. And so they try to divide us. Who would’ve thought that when Joe Biden won the White House, we’d be waiting to see who would have the majority of the Senate, and what are the chances that you’d need two Senate seats, and they’d both be in the same state? And if somebody gave you those odds and said, “You’ll need two Senate seats, they’ll both be in the same state. You get to pick the state.” Who would’ve picked Georgia? Well, we got the last laugh. Georgia saved the whole nation.

Crowd (19:33):

Yeah.

Raphael Warnock (19:49):

Georgia, you saved the nation one time. And I’ve got a feeling that Georgia is going to save the nation one more time. Listen…

Crowd (20:01):

Georgia, Georgia, Georgia, Georgia, Georgia, Georgia, Georgia, Georgia, Georgia, Georgia, Georgia, Georgia.

Raphael Warnock (20:19):

Georgia is on everybody’s mind. And there’s a reason. Because of what you did in 2020 and 2021, everybody knows that the road to the White House goes through Georgia. Madam Vice President knows it, but I’ll tell you, she’s not the only one who knows it. There are other folk who know it. In fact, I heard a phone call. Where a Florida man called into Georgia and said, “I need 11,870 votes.” No. I want you to think about that. Georgia, Donald Trump tried to steal your vote, Kamala Harris is trying to earn your vote.

(21:47)
And she’s been doing it. I can tell you all the ways in which she’s been doing it, but I want you to think about this. Because that same Donald Trump who said, “Can you just find me 11,000?” I heard him say, listen, because this struck me with a certain kind of deep, deep frustration as a Christian pastor. I heard Donald Trump say to a Christian group that, “If you vote for me, you won’t have to worry about ever voting again.”

Crowd (22:37):

Boo.

Raphael Warnock (22:44):

And he said that like that was some good news. We out of the state of John Lewis. We are the home state of Andrew Young and C.T. Vivian. We are the home state of Martin Luther King Jr. and you dare say to me, that if you vote for me, you won’t have to vote again? That doesn’t sound like freedom, that sounds like bondage. And so this campaign folks is about freedom.

Crowd (23:27):

Yeah.

Raphael Warnock (23:29):

And so the question is, do you want to be free?

Crowd (23:31):

Yeah.

Raphael Warnock (23:31):

Or do you want to go back?

Crowd (23:31):

No.

Raphael Warnock (23:31):

We want freedom, right?

Crowd (23:38):

Yeah.

Raphael Warnock (23:38):

If you want freedom, you got to vote like you’ve never voted before. You got to call everybody you know and tell them to show up. When we show up, we win. We flip this state, and Kamala Harris standing next to Joe Biden capped the cost of insulin, my bill to no more than $35 of out-of-pocket costs. We passed the infrastructure bill, which is landing in streets all across our state. We invested in clean energy, we supported struggling farmers, we supported families, and we need a president who will get Georgia to finally do the right thing and expand Medicaid so we don’t need to cover 40,000 Georgians in the Medicaid gap. We don’t need somebody trying to tear up the Affordable Care Act. We need somebody who’ll stand with us.

Crowd (24:44):

Yeah.

Raphael Warnock (24:46):

We need somebody who will tell us that we have to stand together.

Crowd (24:48):

Yeah.

Raphael Warnock (24:49):

And so… I’m so proud to stand with Kamala Harris. Think about this. Her dad is of Jamaican descent. Her mother is of South Asian descent. And then she went to the great Howard University. Worked in California, worked in the United States Senate. That is the American story. And she brings all of those strands together. She sees us because in a real sense, she is all of us.

Crowd (25:39):

Yeah.

Raphael Warnock (25:43):

So we’ve got to send her to the White House.

Crowd (25:45):

Yeah.

Raphael Warnock (25:45):

Now, maybe it’s because I’m a pastor. Some days I feel sorry for Republicans, because they’ve got to figure out how to run a criminal against a prosecutor.

Crowd (26:10):

Yeah.

Raphael Warnock (26:10):

Kamala Harris is getting ready to prosecute the case.

Crowd (26:13):

Yeah.

Raphael Warnock (26:13):

The American people are the jury.

Crowd (26:13):

Yeah.

Raphael Warnock (26:13):

We’re going to get the verdict right.

Crowd (26:13):

Yeah.

Raphael Warnock (26:19):

And we’re going to send Kamala Harris back to the White House.

Crowd (26:21):

Yeah.

Raphael Warnock (26:22):

Are you ready to win this election?

Crowd (26:22):

Yeah.

Raphael Warnock (26:33):

As I close, and nobody believes a preacher when he says, “As I close.” I’ve had many great experiences already with Madam Vice President. But I can’t forget that day when we did an incredible thing. I have to tell you, I love this job because one of the most amazing things I got to do was confirm, first of all, more Black women to the federal judiciary, and all administrations combined. We got to confirm Ketanji Brown Jackson to the United States Supreme Court. And when we did that, the vice president was sitting in the chair. Cory Booker and I were standing there talking to her, waiting on the vote to open. And she said, “Gentlemen, this is quite a moment. You know what you ought to do? You ought to take this moment and write a letter to somebody that comes to your mind.” She made that suggestion to us, you know, the way Black women make suggestions. And then she handed each of us, United States Senators, a sheet of paper. But it wasn’t just any sheet of paper, it was

Raphael Warnock (28:00):

… the letterhead of the Vice President of the United States of America. So I sat down and I wrote a letter to my five-year-old daughter. She was five at the time, Chloe. And I said, “Dear Chloe, today we confirmed to the United States Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. In the history of our nation, she’s the first Supreme Court Justice that looks like you with hair like yours. As we were confirming her, a friend of mine, the Vice President, suggested that I write a letter. By the way, she’s the first Vice President that looks like you. I write to say that in America you can be anything you set your head and your heart to be. Love, Dad.”

(29:05)
I wrote that letter to my five-year-old daughter. I was so caught up with enthusiasm, I called her on FaceTime to read the letter. She’s five years old, she listened to the letter, she was not impressed. She said, “Can I go out and play now?” She didn’t understand that letter then, but she’ll understand it in a few years. I wrote that letter to my daughter. But, Georgia, America, now is our time to write a letter to all of our children. Now is our time to write a letter to the future. Are you ready to write a letter to the future? Are you ready to tell your children that you stood up for democracy? That you stood up for a woman’s right to choose? That you stood up for health care? That you stood up for the dignity of work? Are you ready to write a letter that says you stood up for the planet, that you embraced an America that embraces all of our children? Together we did it before, and together we will do it again. God bless you.

Speaker 2 (30:48):

One more time, Atlanta, Georgia, for our dream team senators, Senator Jon Ossoff and Senator Raphael Warnock.

Quavo (01:17:25):

Yes. How y’all doing out there? How y’all doing?

Audience (01:17:26):

Woo. Yah.

Quavo (01:17:31):

If y’all don’t know me, I go by the name of Quavo.

Audience (01:17:33):

Yah. Yah.

Quavo (01:17:34):

Born, born and raised in the north side of Atlanta, home of Migos.

Audience (01:17:39):

Yah. Woo.

Quavo (01:17:45):

Um, this here has always been home to me from playing in the streets and, you know, no- nurturing me and teaching me how to be the man I am standing before you.

(01:17:54)
So, um, I mean one of these issues that I care about is, is, is resolving the gun violence issue.

Audience (01:18:00):

Yah. Woo.

Quavo (01:18:05):

And you can’t understand the struggles of gun violence if you’re not in the field or in the heart of it.

(01:18:11)
So one thing I learned about working with Vice President Harris is she always stand no business.

Audience (01:18:16):

Yah.

Quavo (01:18:21):

From inviting me… from inviting me… What’s up Mamma? Uh, from inviting me to the White House last year to discuss these solutions to passing, to passing the biggest gun safety laws to date.

Audience (01:18:32):

Woo. Yah.

Quavo (01:18:38):

So it’s only right in the birthplace of the culture.

Audience (01:18:41):

Woo.

Quavo (01:18:41):

It’s also the same place to launch the first African American woman to run for president.

Audience (01:18:51):

Woo. Yah.

Quavo (01:18:51):

Yeah, we changing the culture again.

Audience (01:18:53):

Yah. Woo.

Quavo (01:18:56):

So if you never voted before, make sure you get out and vote right now ’cause it’s the real one.

Audience (01:19:00):

Yeah. Woo.

Quavo (01:19:04):

And in the words of my brother Takeoff, let me get a Kamala.

Audience (01:19:07):

Kamala. Woo.

Quavo (01:19:11):

I’m going to hand it over to Tyler Green. I’m gonna hand it over to Tyler Green, let him talk about his vote and introduce the next President of the United States of America. Yes, sir.

Audience (01:19:21):

Woo. Yah.

Tyler Green (01:19:42):

Hello everyone. Can you hear me?

Audience (01:19:45):

Yeah.

Tyler Green (01:19:45):

All right. My name is Tyler Green and I am so honored to be introducing the next President of the United States of America, Vice President Kamala Harris.

Audience (01:20:02):

Woo. Yah.

Tyler Green (01:20:18):

Just a second. Just a second. Listen. Listen. Listen. As a proud Morehouse man-

Audience (01:20:29):

Woo.

Tyler Green (01:20:35):

… I couldn’t be more excited to welcome a fellow HBCU alum back to the beautiful city of Atlanta.

(01:20:40)
I first met the Vice President at the White House last year, where I shared my story as a young Black entrepreneur. I talked about the challenges that I faced, the importance of investing in entrepreneurs of color, how we can work together to fight the climate change crisis and the positive impact that the Biden-Harris administration has had on my communities.

(01:21:11)
And it means so much to me to see a Vice President leading with the same values of excellence, leadership, and service that our institutions instilled in us.

Audience (01:21:22):

Yeah.

Tyler Green (01:21:26):

Vice President Harris has spent every day of her career fighting for working people just like me. From her service as a district attorney, attorney general, and the United States Supreme… Sorry, the Senate.

Audience (01:21:42):

(laughing)

Tyler Green (01:21:42):

Not yet. To her leadership as Vice President, she has served and spent every day of her career serving and fighting for us, the People.

Audience (01:21:52):

Woo.

Tyler Green (01:21:56):

To name just a few of these accomplishments, she’s fought for historic investments into HBCUs-

Audience (01:22:00):

Yeah.

Tyler Green (01:22:07):

She’s fought for student debt relief.

Audience (01:22:09):

Woo.

Tyler Green (01:22:14):

She’s fought for reproductive freedom.

Audience (01:22:21):

Yeah.

Tyler Green (01:22:21):

She’s fought for entrepreneurs and climate leaders like me.

Audience (01:22:24):

Yeah.

Tyler Green (01:22:28):

And I know that when Georgia sends her to the White House again-

Audience (01:22:32):

Yeah.

Tyler Green (01:22:36):

… she will continue to fight for us. There’s so much at stake in this election. We know that we can’t afford to let Donald Trump and JD Vance-

Audience (01:22:47):

No.

Tyler Green (01:22:47):

… enact their extreme project 2025 agenda on our communities and send us to the past. And that’s what Trump wants to do. Trump wants to drag us back into the past.

Audience (01:23:09):

Yeah. Boo.

Tyler Green (01:23:10):

But listen… but just listen. We have a champion here with us tonight.

Audience (01:23:15):

Woo.

Tyler Green (01:23:18):

And she is going to lead our country into the future.

Audience (01:23:22):

Yeah.

Tyler Green (01:23:22):

Now, it’s my honor-

Audience (01:23:24):

Yah. Woo.

Tyler Green (01:23:30):

… to introduce the next President of the United States, Kamala Harris.

Audience (01:23:36):

Woo. Yah.

Kamala Harris (01:25:30):

Good evening. Good evening, Georgia. Good evening. Good evening.

(01:25:30)
Thank you all. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

(01:25:30)
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you everyone. Thank you. Thank you.

(01:25:30)
Thank you all. Thank you very much. Thank you everybody. Oh, it’s good to be back in Georgia. Thank you, everyone. Can we please hear it for, Tyler?

(01:25:39)
I want to thank Tyler for that incredible introduction. I invited him and several other young entrepreneurs to come and visit me at the White House and we’ve had a really very long and important conversation about the future of America. Tyler, you represent the best of our future. Thank you for that.

(01:26:02)
And please give it up for Quavo, and Megan. So it is so good to see everyone. And let me also thank our incredible members of Congress who are with us this evening, Senator John Ossoff, Senator Raphael Warnock and Representative Nikema Williams. To Mayor Andre Dickens, thank you for welcoming me back to Atlanta. And thank you to the great Stacey Abrams for your extraordinary leadership. So Georgia, it is so good to be back, and I am very clear. The path to the White House runs right through this state. And you all helped us win in 2020, and we’re going to do it again in 2024. Yes, we will. Yes, we will.

(01:27:18)
So let’s get right down …

Audience (01:27:18):

We love you.

Kamala Harris (01:27:32):

So, I’m going to get into some business now. Okay? I’m going to get into some business now. All right.

(01:27:38)
So, Georgia, as many of you know, before, and have a seat, if you have a chair. As many of you know, before I was elected vice president and before I was elected a United States senator, I was an elected attorney general and an elected district attorney. And before that, I was a courtroom prosecutor.

(01:28:09)
So, in those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds: predators who abused women; fraudsters who ripped off consumers; cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So, hear me when I say, I know Donald Trump’s type. I know the type. And I have been dealing with people like him my entire career.

(01:28:56)
For example, as attorney general of California, I took on one of our country’s largest for-profit colleges that was scamming students. Well, Donald Trump ran a for-profit college that scammed students.

(01:29:18)
As a prosecutor, I specialized in child sexual abuse cases and sexual abuse cases. Well, Trump was found liable for committing sexual abuse. And as an attorney general, I held the big Wall Street banks accountable for fraud. Donald Trump was just found guilty of fraud, 34 counts.

(01:29:58)
So in this campaign-

Audience (01:29:58):

Lock him up. Lock him up. Lock him up. Lock him up. Lock him up. Lock him up. Lock him up. Lock him up.

Kamala Harris (01:30:03):

So, in this campaign, I will proudly put my record against his any day of the week, any day of the week, including, for example, on the issue of immigration.

(01:30:22)
So, I was the attorney general of a border state. In that job, I walked underground tunnels between the United States and Mexico on that border with law enforcement officers. I went after transnational gangs, drug cartels, and human traffickers that came into our country illegally. I prosecuted them in case after case, and I won.

(01:30:53)
Donald Trump, on the other hand, has been talking a big game about securing our border, but he does not walk the walk or as my friend Quavo would say, he does not walk it like he talks it.

(01:31:12)
Where’s Quavo?

(01:31:23)
So, look, our administration worked on the most significant border security bill in decades. Some of the most conservative Republicans in Washington, D.C., supported the bill. Even the Border Patrol endorsed it. It was all set to pass. But at the last minute, Trump directed his allies in the Senate to vote it down.

(01:31:59)
Right. He tanked, tanked the bipartisan deal because he thought it would help him win an election, which goes to show Donald Trump does not care about border security; he only cares about himself.

(01:32:27)
And when I am president, I will work to actually solve the problem. So, here is my pledge to you. As president, I will bring back the border security bill that Donald Trump killed, and I will sign it into law and show Donald Trump what real leadership looks like. But make no mistake, this campaign is not just about us versus Donald Trump. Truly, this campaign is about two very different visions for our nation: one focused on the future, the other focused on the past.

(01:33:27)
We believe in a future where every person has the opportunity to build a business, to own a home, to build intergenerational wealth; a future with affordable health care, affordable childcare, paid leave.

(01:33:54)
And all of this is to say: building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency. Because we here all know, when our middle class is strong, America is strong.

(01:34:17)
And to keep our middle class strong, families need relief from the high cost of living so that they have a chance not just to get by but to get ahead.

(01:34:41)
And, yes, it is true that by many indicators, our economy is the strongest in the world, but while inflation is down and wages are up, prices are still too high. You know it, and I know it.

(01:34:59)
And when we win this election, here’s what we’re going to do about it. On day one, I will take on price gouging and bring down costs. We will ban more of those hidden fees and surprise late charges that banks and other companies use to pad their profits. We will take on corporate landlords and cap unfair rent increases. And we will take on Big Pharma to cap prescription drug costs for all Americans.

(01:35:50)
Our plan will lower costs and save many middle-class families thousands of dollars a year. But Donald Trump has a different plan in mind, one that would raise prices on middle-class families. Just look at his Project 2025 agenda.

(01:36:14)
I take it you’ve seen it.

(01:36:17)
Project 2025 is a plan to weaken the middle class, be clear. And Donald Trump intends to cut Social Security and Medicare. He intends to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations.

(01:36:36)
He intends to gut our investments in clean energy jobs. He intends to end the Affordable Care Act to take us back to a time when insurance companies had the power to deny people with preexisting conditions. Do you guys remember what that was? Children with asthma. Breast cancer survivors. Grandparents with diabetes.

(01:37:09)
Georgia, America has tried these failed policies before, and we are not going back.

Audience (01:37:15):

Going back!

Kamala Harris (01:37:15):

We’re not going back.

Audience (01:37:15):

We’re not going back! We’re not going back!

Kamala Harris (01:37:15):

We’re not going back.

Audience (01:37:23):

We’re not going back! We’re not going back! We’re not going back! We’re not going back! We’re not going back! We’re not going back!

Kamala Harris (01:37:23):

That’s right.

Audience (01:37:23):

We’re not going back!

Kamala Harris (01:37:37):

And we are not going back because ours is a fight for the future and it is a fight for freedom.

(01:37:49)
Across our nation, we are witnessing a full-on assault on hard-fought, hard-won freedoms and rights: the freedom to vote; the freedom to be safe from gun violence; the freedom to live without fear of bigotry and hate; the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride; the freedom to learn and acknowledge our true and full history; and the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do.

(01:38:33)
Ours is a fight for the future and for freedom. And I don’t have to tell folks in Atlanta that generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom. And now the baton is in our hands. Each and every one of us.

(01:39:12)
And we love our country. We love our country. And I believe it is the highest form of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country.

(01:39:24)
And so, we, who believe in the sacred freedom to vote, will finally pass the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.

(01:39:48)
We, who believe in the freedom to live safe from gun violence, will finally pass universal background checks, red flag laws, and an assault weapons ban.

(01:40:07)
We, who believe in reproductive freedom will stop Donald Trump’s extreme abortion bans. And when Congress passes a law to restore reproductive freedoms as President of the United States, I will sign it into law.

(01:40:26)
So, November 5th is in 98 days.

(01:40:42)
In 98 days, and let’s level set. Friends, let’s level set. We have a fight in front of us. We have a fight in front of us, and we are the underdogs in this race. We are. But you see, this is a people-powered campaign. Ours is a people-powered campaign.

(01:41:16)
In fact, after I announced my candidacy, we saw the best week of grassroots fundraising in presidential campaign history. And if you go to kamalaharris. com, you can help us build on that success.

(01:41:39)
So, the momentum in this race is shifting. And there are signs that Donald Trump is feeling it. You may have noticed.

(01:41:53)
So, last week, you may have seen, he pulled out of the debate in September he had previously agreed to.

(01:42:07)
So, here’s the thing. Here’s the funny thing about that. Here’s the funny thing about that. So, he won’t debate, but he and his running mate sure seem to have a lot to say about me.

(01:42:25)
And, by the way, don’t you find some of their stuff to just be plain weird? Well, Donald, I do hope you’ll reconsider to meet me on the debate stage because, as the saying goes, if you’ve got something to say, say it to my face.

Audience (01:43:02):

Kamala! Kamala! Kamala! Kamala! Kamala! Kamala! Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!

Kamala Harris (01:43:47):

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So, Georgia, in the next 98 days, we have our work cut out for us. And this is not going to be easy. This is hard work, but we like hard work. Hard work is good work. So, Georgia, today I ask you: Are you ready to get to work?

Audience (01:44:04):

Yes.

Kamala Harris (01:44:04):

Do we believe in freedom?

Audience (01:44:04):

Yes.

Kamala Harris (01:44:11):

Do we believe in opportunity?

Audience (01:44:13):

Yes.

Kamala Harris (01:44:13):

Do we believe in the promise of America?

Audience (01:44:19):

Yes.

Kamala Harris (01:44:19):

And are we ready to fight for it?

Audience (01:44:21):

Yes.

Kamala Harris (01:44:21):

And when we fight, we win.

Audience (01:44:21):

We win.

Kamala Harris (01:44:21):

God bless you. God bless the United States of America.
